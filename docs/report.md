# Software Report
In this report, we will outline the challenges our software addresses and the benefits it offers to both users and the business.
## The problem the software aims to  solve
Traditional methods - such as using pen and paper to keep track of contacts - are outdated and problematic. These record-keeping techniques pose the risk of misplacing, duplicating, and incorrectly recording contact details. Not to mention, manually updating contact information is tedious and inefficient, and searching for a specific contact in a large dataset without proper tools is time-consuming. Our software eradicates the risk of duplicate or incorrect entries, thus, eliminating confusion and miscommunication.
## Benefits to the user
A dedicated address book application ensures ease of access and organisation by providing users with a centralised place to store all their contact information. As a result, the software allows users to quickly search for contacts in any size dataset, making the information they need easy to find without having to sift through numerous entries. Users can effortlessly add, edit, or remove contacts which allows them to keep their address book always up-to-date. Additionally, the software reduces redundant data by preventing duplicate entries of phone numbers and email addresses, making the data more readable and user-friendly.

## Benefits to businesses
This software also provides considerable benefits to businesses. A well-maintained address book directly contributes to the professionalism of a business. Employees and users alike will spend less time managing and searching for contacts, therefore allowing them to focus on other tasks. The software ensures the address book contains accurate and up-to-date contact information, allowing businesses to maintain better communication standards with clients, partners, and employees. Thus, enabling companies to promptly contact and manage clients, boosting client confidence in the business's reliability.  Furthermore, as the business grows, the address book can scale accordingly, accommodating more contacts and potentially integrating with other systems and databases in future iterations.
